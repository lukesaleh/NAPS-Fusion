    "# Overview of the Dataset:\n",
    "# Number of Features: 11 features (narrower but still good for Random Forests).\n",
    "# Number of Classes: 3 classes (Quality ratings of 3, 5, 8).\n",
    "# Samples: 1,599 samples for red wine and 4,898 samples for white wine.\n",
    "# Number of Features: 11 features (all numeric).\n",
    "# Target Variable (Quality): The quality of the wine, measured on a scale from 0 to 10, though most of the ratings are between 3 and 8.\n",
    "# Features:\n",
    "# The dataset captures 11 physicochemical properties of the wine, which are typically related to its chemical composition, acidity, sweetness, and other measurable characteristics. These features can influence the taste, aroma, and quality of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here’s a breakdown of each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fixed Acidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures non-volatile acids (e.g., tartaric acid).\n",
    "# These acids don’t evaporate during the winemaking process and contribute to the sour taste of the wine.\n",
    "# Volatile Acidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures volatile acids (e.g., acetic acid).\n",
    "# A higher value can lead to a vinegary taste, affecting the quality negatively.\n",
    "# Citric Acid:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adds freshness and a slight acidic taste to the wine.\n",
    "# Low levels can lead to a flat-tasting wine.\n",
    "# Residual Sugar:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The amount of sugar left after fermentation.\n",
    "# Higher sugar levels often mean sweeter wines, while dry wines have lower residual sugar.\n",
    "# Chlorides:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures the salt content in wine.\n",
    "# Excessive chlorides can give the wine an undesirable salty taste.\n",
    "# Free Sulfur Dioxide:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sulfur dioxide prevents microbial growth and oxidation.\n",
    "# It’s the portion of total sulfur dioxide that is not bound and remains available for protection.\n",
    "# Total Sulfur Dioxide:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Total amount of SO2 in the wine.\n",
    "# Excessive sulfur dioxide can result in unpleasant aromas.\n",
    "# Density:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Related to the sugar and alcohol content of wine.\n",
    "# Higher density indicates a sweeter wine.\n",
    "# pH:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures the acidity of the wine on a scale of 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).\n",
    "# Wine typically has a pH between 3 and 4.\n",
    "# Sulphates:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Acts as an antioxidant and preservative.\n",
    "# Sulphates can also contribute to the bitterness of the wine.\n",
    "# Alcohol:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV).\n",
    "# Higher alcohol content usually contributes positively to the wine's body and quality.\n",
    "# Target Variable (Quality):\n",
    "# The quality score is the target variable. It is an integer value that represents the sensory quality of the wine, based on the taste ratings provided by wine experts. The quality scores range from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent), but in this dataset, most wines are rated between 3 and 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quality Rating:\n",
    "# Low (3-4): Poor-quality wines.\n",
    "# Medium (5-6): Average-quality wines.\n",
    "# High (7-8): High-quality wines."
